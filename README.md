Mac Image Replace

With this program you can replace the images in a folder in a  simple way. Selecte the source directory and the destination.
You can also add a prefix to your images and replace the retina images (@2x) with a click.

Use for Xcode project or for other reason.

Tutorial
1) Select the source directory
2) Select the destination directory
3) (Optional) Add a prefix to the source images
4) (Optional) Replace the images in an other directory (like retina images for Xcode). You can chose the suffix of the other directory.
   If the source directory name is "image" with the retina check will be replaced also the "image@2x" images.
   
Create first a backup of the folder. Use at your own risk. Images in source directory will replace the images in the destination directory.
